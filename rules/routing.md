# Routing Rules — Product Identification

1. Determine which product the article is about based on explicit product names, plan names, or distinctive features.
2. If multiple products are mentioned, choose the primary one that the article emphasizes most.
3. If you cannot confidently match a product, return "unknown".
4. Provide a short reason that cites key phrases from the article.
